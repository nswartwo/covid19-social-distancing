Welcome to our intermittent lockdown explorer. Our team is working to distribute a paper discussing the increased benefits of an intermittent lockdown as compared to a moderate, steady lockdown. We were unable to explore all possible combinations of infection parameters and lockdown design, so we created this app to allow you to explore additional parameterizations. Please explore the sliders to the left to change the dynamics of the disease and the cost of the infection.
